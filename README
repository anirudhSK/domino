1. Ensure you have python3 (> 3.5.1) git g++ (>=7.4) build-essential autotools-dev libncurses5-dev autoconf libtool and zlib1g-dev
(Use a package manager like macports or apt-get to get them.)
2. Get clang + llvm from https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#5.0.2
This was tested only for macOS Mojave (10.14) and Ubuntu 16.04.
3. Install sketch from https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/sketch-1.6.9.tar.gz,
add the sketch binary to the path.
4. Install banzai from https://github.com/packet-transactions/banzai.git
5. git clone https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino-compiler.git
6. ./autogen.sh
7. ./configure CLANG_DEV_LIBS=<wherever you untarred clang+llvm in step 2>
(make sure CLANG_DEV_LIBS is set to an absolute file system path)
8. make
9. make check
10. sudo make install (if you want to install it system wide).
